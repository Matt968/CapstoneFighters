                <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    Our stretch goals mainly focus on additional multiplayer
                    options that are more complex to implement. Our basic
                    goal is to create a matchmaking system that takes
                    the first people in the stack and places them into a
                    match together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we would like to go further beyond this, and
                    implement profiles for each player. This would allow us
                    to track some basic player information, such as a
                    ranking system, so we could implement a competitive
                    matchmaking system. Furthermore, we could also use this
                    to allow a friends system to exist. You could search for
                    your friends, and once friend requests are accepted, you
                    could enter matches with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, we would also love to introduce as many
                    unique characters to the roster as we can in the time we
                    are given. We want to open up fun and engaging playstyles,
                    with awesome characters behind it!
